# DNS Injector

The DNS packet injector will capture the traffic from a network interface in 
promiscuous mode, and attempt to inject forged responses to selected DNS A requests 
with the goal to poison the resolver's cache.

Program conform to the following specification:

dnsinject [-i interface] [-h hostnames] expression

-i  Listen on network device <interface> (e.g., eth0). If not specified,
    dnsinject should select a default interface to listen on. The same
    interface should be used for packet injection.

-h  Read a list of IP address and hostname pairs specifying the hostnames to
    be hijacked. If '-h' is not specified, dnsinject should forge replies for
    all observed requests with the local machine's IP address as an answer.
    
expression is a BPF filter that specifies a subset of the traffic to be
monitored. This option is useful for targeting a single or a set of particular
victims.

The hostnames file should contain one IP and hostname pair per line,
separated by whitespace, in the following format:
10.6.6.6      foo.example.com

10.6.6.6      bar.example.com

# DNS Detector

The DNS poisoning attack detector will capture the traffic from a network 
interface in promiscuous mode and detect DNS poisoning attack attempts, 
such as those generated by dnsinject. Detection will be based on identifying 
duplicate responses towards the same destination that contain different answers 
for the same A request, i.e., the observation of the attacker's spoofed response 
followed by the server's actual response. You should make every effort to avoid 
false positives, e.g., due to legitimate consecutive responses with different IP 
addresses for the same hostname due to round robin DNS load balancing.

Program should conform to the following specification:

dnsdetect [-i interface] [-r tracefile] expression

-i  Listen on network device <interface> (e.g., eth0). If not specified,
    the program should select a default interface to listen on.

-r  Read packets from <tracefile> (tcpdump format). Useful for detecting
    DNS poisoning attacks in existing network traces.

monitored.
